# Goal
My goal was to create a platform where users could track their expenses easily, allowing them to add, remove, and update income/expenses, add a small description to each, and categorize them to be able to fetch by category later.
# Contribution
I started by designing the app overall structure (first identifying main components as DB schema and code models), then having a sketch for the UI was useful as it saved me a lot of time later.
# Achieved
I was then able to create the backend using Golang and MySQL, while the client was created using ReactJS, after I made sure that the app is functioning as expected, I went through implementing a mobile client (which was created by Kotlin).
